At this point, the multiline comprehension isnâ€™t much shorter than the 
alternative. The indentation of the for loop version makes the looping clearer 
than the list comprehension. 

Usage: list1.extens(list2)
The extend() extends list1 by adding all items of a list2 to the end.

""" 
List comprehensions also support multiple if conditions. Multiple conditions 
at the same loop level are an implicit 'and' expression. For example, say you 
want to filter a list of numbers to only even values greater than four. 
These two list comprehensions are equivalent.

""" 
The rule of thumb is to avoid using more than two expressions in a list 
comprehension. This could be two conditions, two loops, or one condition 
and one loop. As soon as it gets more complicated than that, you should 
use normal if and for statements and write a helper function
